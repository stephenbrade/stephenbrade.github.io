I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto co-supervised by Prof. Tovi Grossman of DGP and Prof. Sageev Oore of the Vector Institute.

I am interested in designing experimental applications that augment human creativity with AI. In the first half of my Master's, I focused on designing a novel interactive system that used chat optimized large language models to enhance how user's prompt text-to-image models. Right now, I am focused on using text-to-audio models like LAION-CLAP to make sound synthesis more intuitive and expressive for novices.

I recieved my bachelor's degree in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto where I majored in Machine Intelligence. I also completed a professional experience year working at AMD as a Machine Learning engineer where I developed in-house applications to aid with the detection of regressive code.

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto co-supervised by Prof. Tovi Grossman of DGP and Prof. Sageev Oore of the Vector Institute. I am currently looking for positions in academia and industry where I can continue to create new systems that enhance the our abilities to create music.

In my Master's, I focused on designing experimental applications that augmented human creativity with AI. I just completed a project, SynthScribe, which facilitates the use synthesizers by letting musicians use text and audio as an intuitive control modality. We acheive this by building several features on top of LAION-CLAP that allow musicians to search for and modify synthesizer sounds while also allowing musicians to create completely new sounds. In the first half of my Master's, I focused on designing a novel interactive system that used chat optimized large language models to facilitate the use of text-to-image models.

I recieved my bachelor's degree in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto where I majored in Machine Intelligence. I also completed a professional experience year working at AMD as a Machine Learning engineer where I developed in-house applications to aid with the detection of regressive code.

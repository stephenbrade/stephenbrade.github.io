I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Anna Huang. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence, where I focus on designing new systems that enhance our ability to create music. I aim to enable live collaborations between musicians and powerful generative models, seamlessly integrating these technologies with traditional practices like improvisation and performance.

I previously completed my master's and bachelor's degrees at the University of Toronto, where I was co-supervised by Prof. Tovi Grossman and Prof. Sageev Oore. My work culminated in publications at  *__ACM IUI__*, *__ACM UIST__*,  and the *__NeurIPS workshop for Creativity and Design__*. I have also completed internships at AMD as a Machine Learning Engineer and, most recently, at Adobe, where I collaborated with Anh Truong and Zeyu Jin to enhance interactions with text-to-speech technologies.
